                    We personally tried several of Nashville's most recommended burgers and ranked them according to a well thought out scoring system.
                    <br><br>
                    Burgers were ranked on the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <u>Taste (0-10):</u> The overall taste and finish of the burger.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <u>Quality (0-5):</u> The quality, freshness of the ingredients, and the craftsmanship of the burger.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <u>Temperature (0-3):</u> The temperature of the meat, how well the natural juices and flavor of the meat is announced.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <u>Presentation (0-2):</u> Not just how well the burger looks plated,
                        but how original the sandwich is and how easy it is to handle and savor throughout the meal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <i>20 is the highest possible total and they are scored in .5 point increments</i>
